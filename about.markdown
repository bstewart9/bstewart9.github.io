I'm a passionate full-stack developer in training, eager to explore the world of web and software development.

Currently pursuing a full-stack development program at college, I'm committed to mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.

Aspiring to be a well-rounded developer, I'm actively honing my skills in front-end and back-end development to build dynamic and user-friendly web applications
